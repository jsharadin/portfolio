# Human Health Through Digital Humanities

This project investigates disparities in healthcare access and quality through the lens of socio-economic status, race, and gender. Using data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other sources, we explore how structural inequalities affect health outcomes, with a focus on marginalized communities.

## Key Components:
- **Annotated Bibliography**: Curated research sources on health disparities.
- **Data Critique**: Critical examination of the datasets used.
- **WHO Data Analysis**: Statistical insights drawn from WHO's Global Health Observatory data.
- **Covid Vaccine Data Analysis**: Exploration of disparities in vaccination rates across populations.

## Intersectional Frameworks Applied:
- **Critical Race Theory (CRT)**: Examining structural racism in healthcare.  
- **Critical Disability Theory (CDT)**: Investigating accessibility issues for disabled patients.  
- **Feminist Theory**: Exploring gender biases in healthcare policies and outcomes.  

## Research Focus:
- How socio-economic status affects access to preventive care.
- Racial disparities in healthcare quality and patient outcomes.
- Gender-based healthcare inequities and maternal health disparities.
